# Inspiration :

Once I interacted with a customer , who had extremely innovative mindset and he had crazy ideas that could help billions of people. But everytime he created some applications , he faced operation challenges and he spent his most time dealing with them. I wanted to create something so that people who have extreme brilliant mind and thinking to deliver application that creates positive impact to a larger society , they can create and deliver them to mass with less operations.

Today business demand scalability , agility , performance , reliability , security , governance at a low cost. Gone are the days where we could afford to keep thousands of servers , storage , network , many operation support people and many application developer and still facing the scalability and reliability issues. Customers need to achieve more in less. There are few companies like facebook , google , linkedin who has created a biggest success stories , but their entire IT is managed by a few smart programmers. The embraced devops culture , achieved more in less. Why not some of the lessons from their success stories be applied to every it organization..
