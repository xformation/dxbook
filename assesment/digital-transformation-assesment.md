# IT TRANSFORMATION ASSESSMENT

Today business needs to address volume, velocity more reliably in less cost. Making transformation to the existing system to address the volume and velocity, has proved to be more of a challenging for most businesses. With several different service and delivery models, decisions such as to what tool to use and how to transform your systems to the modern technologies can prove to be dicult. To help organizations navigate through the transformation, Synectiks has designed a custom transformation assessment to help get you started with confidence.

## Our Approach

```
We specialize in building Microservices across clouds in complete software defined way. Our Devops expertise help 
customers to become Hardware / OS / Operation / Vendor Agnostics and achieve scalability, reliability in less cost. 
Our experience and expertise on large scale transformation projects helps organization to embrace Devops culture with
ease and speed.

```

## IT Transformation Assessment

```
We will conduct a 360-degree assessment of the current product, processes, within the company. This assessment will 
include a detailed audit of scalability, HA, management, security, performance, data protection aspects of the product. 
We will develop a IT transformation roadmap that can be used for advancement of Microservices adoption and the benefits 
that can be achieved. We will conduct POC’s to validate the proposed Microservices and Software Defined Transformation.

```

```
The assessment will include a detailed review and plan for an organization:

```

1. Business Readiness
2. Existing Infrastructure and Applications Review
3. Migration Path

# ASSESSMENT AND MIGRATION PLAN

## Business Readiness

Our team will host interactive consultations with key stakeholders to determine business processes, goals, opportunities and cultural readiness of the organization. Any change management or training considerations will also be identified as well as a costbenefit analysis. Components to be reviewed includes:

##  1. Business Environment

* Business Transformation Challenges
* Pain points
* Risk Tolerance
* Resistance to change

## 2. Business Impact

* Customer Experience
* Revenue
* Cost
* Time to Market

## 3. Business Processes

* Procurement
* IT process

## Existing Infrastructure and Applications Review

We will conduct a 360 degree review your existing infrastructure and applications and audit them with defined checklists.

## Applications will be reviewed against the following points:

## 1. Scalability

* Application
* Network
* Storage
* Database

## 2. High Availability

* Application
* Network
* Storage
* Database

## 3. Management

* Release / Deployment
* ALM
* OSS

## 4. Security

* Application
* Network
* Storage
* Database

## 5. Performance

* Application
* Network
* Storage
* Database

## 6. Data Protection

* Tooling
* Process
* Compliance

### OSS = Operation Support System, ALM = Application Lifecycle Management

# ASSESSMENT AND MIGRATION PLAN

## Audit Mechanism

```
We will use tools to discover, benchmark, Audit your existing application and infrastructure. We will also share ideal 
case studies and POC’s supporting those case studies. We will use following tools for existing state analysis:

```

**-**Discovery tools  
**-**Audit tools for security audit & network audit  
**-**Benchmarking tools for application and infrastructure performance benchmarking  
**-**Application profiling tools

```
We will conduct POC’s mainly focused on

```

**-**Infrastructure as Code  
**-**Monolith to Microservice Transformation  
**-**Operation Support System towards Auto Pilot Mode  
**-**Effective Application Lifecycle Management

```
Based on the Assessment Report, there may be a need to re-platform internal workloads to make them ready for 
modernization. We will recommend a best practice approach for the re-platforming of workloads based on POC results 
and best practices guidelines. We will work with your team to determine migration schedules and project milestones 
to ensure alignment with your business needs. We will also propose risk mitigation and contingency plan.

```

```
The migration plan will focus on certain key objectives as follows:

```

#### • Everything Software Defined - Infrastructure As Code

#### • Hardware Aggregation And Consolidation

#### • Workload Balance & Integration

#### • Security and Governance

#### • Operation Support System

#### • Application Lifecycle Management

#### • Microservices Transformation

#### • Automation Excellence

# ASSESSMENT AND MIGRATION PLAN

## The following migrations options to be considered include:

**1.**Supplement existing application  
**2.**Integrate cloud workloads with on-premises systems  
**3.**Migrate existing applications  
**4.**Migrate with full microservices transformation

```
You will be provided with a complete Transformation Plan which will include:

```

**-**A clear strategic IT roadmap providing a defined set of activities needed for Transformation  
**-**A detailed 360-degree Audit report of existing Application and Infrastructure  
**-**Solution architecture  
**-**Detailed proof of concept and user experience  
**-**A complete SOA architecture depicting Monolith to Microservices Transformation  
**-**A security and compliance reports of risks to your organization  
**-**Project plan & statement of work for immediate next phase  
**-**Skill set and training plan

```
We will spend time diligently reviewing all deployments and building guides with all stakeholders. At every step we will
also conduct a thorough POC and configuration to ensure a smooth transition and to foster successful change management 
with system administrators.

```

## Deliverables

```
Upon completion of a successful delivery of a Transformation Plan, you will have the framework and plan required to 
transform your IT System either with Synectiks, inhouse, or any other vendor you choose. Synectiks has a skilled pool 
of resources having adequate real-time project execution experience of monolith to microservices transformation. Also 
with Synectiks you will have the advantage of using large amount of automation codebase so that you get upfront return 
on your investment. Our code centric approach and availability of special skillsets (smart coder with infrastructure 
background) helps our customers to reduce the time and cost and achieve reliability.
